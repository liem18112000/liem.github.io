					<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think
					like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a
					human mind such as learning and problem-solving.</p>

					<p>The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the best
					chance of achieving a specific goal.
					</p>

					<p>A subset of artificial intelligence is machine learning, which refers to the concept that computer programs can
					automatically learn from and adapt to new data without being assisted by humans.</p>

					<p>Deep learning techniques enable this automatic learning through the absorption of huge amounts of unstructured data such
					as text, images, or video.</p>

					<h2 class="section-heading">Understanding Artificial Intelligence</h2>

					<p>When most people hear the term artificial intelligence, the first thing they usually think of is robots. That's because
					big-budget films and novels weave stories about human-like machines that wreak havoc on Earth. But nothing could be
					further from the truth.</p>

					<p>Artificial intelligence is based on the principle that human intelligence can be defined in a way that a machine can
					easily mimic it and execute tasks, from the most simple to those that are even more complex. The goals of artificial
					intelligence include mimicking human cognitive activity. Researchers and developers in the field are making surprisingly
					rapid strides in mimicking activities such as learning, reasoning, and perception, to the extent that these can be
					concretely defined. Some believe that innovators may soon be able to develop systems that exceed the capacity of humans
					to learn or reason out any subject. But others remain skeptical because all cognitive activity is laced with value
					judgments that are subject to human experience.</p>

					<blockquote class="blockquote">Algorithms often play a very important part in the structure of artificial intelligence, where simple algorithms are
					used in simple applications, while more complex ones help frame strong artificial intelligence.</blockquote>

					<p>As technology advances, previous benchmarks that defined artificial intelligence become outdated. For example, machines
					that calculate basic functions or recognize text through optical character recognition are no longer considered to
					embody artificial intelligence, since this function is now taken for granted as an inherent computer function.</p>


					<p>
						AI is continuously evolving to benefit many different industries. Machines are wired using a cross-disciplinary approach
						based on mathematics, computer science, linguistics, psychology, and more.
					</p>

					<h2 class="section-heading">Applications of Artificial Intelligence</h2>

					<p>The applications for artificial intelligence are endless. The technology can be applied to many different sectors and
					industries. AI is being tested and used in the healthcare industry for dosing drugs and different treatment in patients,
					and for surgical procedures in the operating room.</p>

					<span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s
						what living is all about.</span>

					<p>Artificial intelligence also has applications in the financial industry, where it is used to detect and flag activity in
					banking and finance such as unusual debit card usage and large account deposits—all of which help a bank's fraud
					department. Applications for AI are also being used to help streamline and make trading easier. This is done by making
					supply, demand, and pricing of securities easier to estimate.</p>

					<h2 class="section-heading">Categorization of Artificial Intelligence</h2>

					<p>Artificial intelligence can be divided into two different categories: weak and strong. Weak artificial intelligence
					embodies a system designed to carry out one particular job. Weak AI systems include video games such as the chess
					example from above and personal assistants such as Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. You ask the assistant a question, it
					answers it for you.</p>

					<p>
						Strong artificial intelligence systems are systems that carry on the tasks considered to be human-like. These tend to be
						more complex and complicated systems. They are programmed to handle situations in which they may be required to problem
						solve without having a person intervene. These kinds of systems can be found in applications like self-driving cars or
						in hospital operating rooms.
					</p>

					<h2 class="section-heading">Special Considerations</h2>

					<p>
						Since its beginning, artificial intelligence has come under scrutiny from scientists and the public alike. One common
						theme is the idea that machines will become so highly developed that humans will not be able to keep up and they will
						take off on their own, redesigning themselves at an exponential rate.
					</p>

					<p>
						Another is that machines can hack into people's privacy and even be weaponized. Other arguments debate the ethics of
						artificial intelligence and whether intelligent systems such as robots should be treated with the same rights as humans.
					</p>

					<p>
						Self-driving cars have been fairly controversial as their machines tend to be designed for the lowest possible risk and
						the least casualties. If presented with a scenario of colliding with one person or another at the same time, these cars
						would calculate the option that would cause the least amount of damage.
					</p>

					<p>
						Another contentious issue many people have with artificial intelligence is how it may affect human employment. With many
						industries looking to automate certain jobs through the use of intelligent machinery, there is a concern that people
						would be pushed out of the workforce. Self-driving cars may remove the need for taxis and car-share programs, while
						manufacturers may easily replace human labor with machines, making people's skills more obsolete.
